# Cross-site request forgery

## Theory

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tricks a logged-in user's browser into sending unwanted requests to a web app, exploiting the browser’s automatic inclusion of cookies or credentials. Attackers can perform unauthorized actions like changing passwords or liking posts without the user’s knowledge.

Key points:
- Victim must be authenticated.
- Exploits trusted session cookies.
- GET requests can be attacked using tags like `<img>`.
- POST requests require more complex methods such as hidden auto-submitted forms or JavaScript.
- Protection involves CSRF tokens, `SameSite` cookies, and header validations.

## Lab 1: Likes!
You have to add 'likes' for a post using a CSRF vulnerability. To do that, you will register at the resource and examine its functionality.

### Steps
- open the machine 
- enter to the website 
1. Register and log in.
2. Visit `/post/1`.
3. Notice the like request is a GET: `/like/1?value=1`.(check this using the burp)
4. We already know that the get we can use the img trick Inject the comment :
   ```html
   <img src="/like/1?value=1">
````

5. Every visitor will send a like automatically.
6. After enough likes which is five, get the flag.

## Lab 2: Likes!
Make "Likes" safer again
### Goal

Fix the CSRF vulnerability by enabling Spring Security’s built-in CSRF protection.

### Steps
1. Open `WebSecurityConfig.java`.
2. Find `.csrf().disable()` and remove `.disable()`:
   ```java
   http
       .csrf()
       .and()
       .authorizeRequests()
       // existing matchers
   ```
3. Fix syntax issues (missing `.and()`, braces).
4. Rebuild and redeploy.
5. Confirm that POST requests now require CSRF tokens.

  ## Lab 3: Post me some like
"Likes" are never superfluous, however, now it will be a little more difficult to wind them up.

Make `/post/1` get more than five likes when the like is done via POST request.

### Steps

1. Register and log in.
2. Observe the like action uses POST `/like/1` with body `value=1`.(using burb)
3. Since `<img>` won’t work for POST, inject this comment:

   ```html
   <form action="/like/1" method="POST" style="display:none;" id="csrfForm">
     <input type="hidden" name="value" value="1" />
   </form>
   <script>
     document.getElementById('csrfForm').submit();
   </script>
   ```
4. Visitors will silently send POST like requests.
5. After 5+ likes, obtain the flag.

### Flag obtained: `CSRF_FLAG_MASTER`

```
